## Connect 4 game

Welcome to Connect 4! This is a simple implementation of the classic Connect 4 game using Python with a graphical interface built using Tkinter.

### Requirements

To run this game, you need to have Python installed on your system. The code has been tested with Python 3.

### How to play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.  
2. Navigate to the directory containing the files.  
3. Run the p4graph.py file using Python. In the terminal type “python p4graph.py”
  
   ```bash  
   python p4graph.py  
    ``` 
5. The graphical interface of the Connect 4 game will open.  
6. Player 1 and Player 2 take turns dropping colored discs into the grid.  
7. The first player to connect four of their discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.  
8. If the grid fills up with discs and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

### Interface control

To make a move, click on the column where you want to drop your disc.  
When the game ends (either by a win or draw), a message box will prompt you to restart the game.

### Enjoy the game ! 

Have fun playing Connect 4 with your friends.
